
Builds ocaml 3.12.0 toolchain

The configure-ocaml removes checks for X11, which results
in omitting the "graph" library from being built.

The set of configure options used will likely only work on
a linux system, and is used to build a 32-bit ocamlopt
compiler even when the host is 64-bit.
